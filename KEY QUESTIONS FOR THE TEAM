1. Problem & Impact (MOST IMPORTANT)

What real problem are we solving, and who experiences it daily?

Is this a problem people would actually care about if we solved it?

Who benefits the most from this solution (students, businesses, government, youth, communities)?



2. Feasibility (Hackathon Reality Check)

Can we build a working prototype within the hackathon time?

What is the minimum version we can build that still shows value (MVP)?

Do we already have or can we quickly learn the skills needed?



3. Team Strengths & Roles

What is each team member best at (coding, design, data, pitching, logic)?

Does this project allow everyone to contribute meaningfully?

Can roles be clearly divided without overlap or confusion?


4. Uniqueness & Innovation

What makes our idea different from existing solutions?

Are we improving something, not just copying it?

Can we clearly explain our “wow factor” in under 30 seconds?



5. Users & Validation

Who is the primary user, and what is their biggest pain point?

How would a user interact with this in 3 simple steps?

If we tested this today, what feedback would we expect?



6. Presentation & Storytelling

Can we clearly explain the problem → solution → impact?

Does this project tell a strong story during the pitch?

Would this project look impressive on our CVs/LinkedIn?
